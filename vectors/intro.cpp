problems with arr-->
static size-->once declared then can be changed
insertions are costly 

Advantes of using Vectors-->
dynamic sized 
rich library functions 
many useful functions --->like sort(v.begin(),v.end()), largest number in  vector, 
find , erase , insert
easy to know the size 
no need to pass the size 
can return the vector from function
by default initialised with default values 
we can copy one vector to another by just -->v1=v2-->all the values of v2 are passed copied to the v1


suppost v is vector-->

to sort the  vector--> sort(v.begin(),v.end());
v.begin() gives the address of first element of vector
v.end() gives the address of memory which is present after the  last element of the vector
